# CryptoAuth Package for Golang

CryptoAuth is the protocol used in [cjdns](https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns) to establish encrypted sessions and communicate with remote peers.

This is a work-in-progress package that implements cryptoauth. This enables you to build your own golang programs that can communicate using the cryptoauth protocol.
